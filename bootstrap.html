The downside of using the cdn is that you can't customize the bootstrap css.
If you wannt be able to do that , you are going to download the source files because that gives you all the 
bootstrap sass files.(sass is a css preprocessor or pre-compiler that allows you edit the bootstrap 
variables like let's say the primary color, secondary color, the font  size of the buttons,...), 
you will have to edit the sass files and then compile it with the  sass compiler.

(1) lg means is when it hits the large break point and you know a certain screen size then the navbar 
        will expand to show all the links, anything under the large is gonna be a hamburger menu.
        You can also use(md) and then it would keep the links shown up until medium.

        For the color of the navbar bg-dark.
        navbar-dark will make the text light since the navbar is dark  -->

<!-- to see color -->

   color

bg-primary: to use the blue background

<!-- we want this to be able collapse on small screens -->
    class="collapse navbar-collapse"   

<!-- push the links(Menu) over to the far right   -->
   in the ul add a class="ms-auto"              (ms:margin start)

<!--data-bs-toggle: the toggle to be collapse, 
    data-bs-target: then we need to target a specific item to toggle  -->   

<!-- margin and paddin use specific class-->
  pt-1 padding top (1-5)  
  pb padding bottom
  px paddin on x-axis (the left and right)
  py padding on y-axis
  p-3 padding all way around

  my-4 : margin on y-axis (top-down)
  ms: margin-start
  me: margin-end

<!-- to use flex box  -->
class="d-flex" : to align items in row (side by side)
d-flex : to use flex box on all sizes(screen)
d-sm-flex: to use flex-box when in sm

<!-- to stop images from break out the container -->
class="img-fluid"    (image bound to the container)

<!-- To reduce the size of image -->
class="w-50"   to make image half the size 

<!-- text -->
class="lead"  : to make the text a little bigger
class="text-sm-start" : from small screen, the text will align to start

<!-- button -->
btn-primary: will make it blue color by default
btn-lg: to make it begger

<!-- display -->
class="d-none"

on very small screens, not to show the image :
 d-none: display none (not show at all devices)
 d-sm-block: to show on anything begger than a small break point 
 conclusion: they have to be together to work:
    class="d-none d-sm-block"
